Making Data-Driven Marketing Decisions Has Never Been This Accessible For years, Marketing Mix Modelling has been the domain of consultancies and annual reports – expensive, opaque and frustratingly static. But what if you could have real-time insights, predictive forecasting and AI-powered optimisation at your fingertips? Welcome to the next generation of MMM. The Challenge Modern Marketers Face Marketing leaders are navigating unprecedented complexity. Click-based attribution models fail to capture the full customer journey, leaving brands without clear insights into what truly drives conversions. Offline media and external factors like seasonality, competitor activity and business dynamics remain invisible in traditional measurement approaches. Meanwhile, CMOs want to know: “How can I convince my CFO to increase budget?” or “Which campaigns truly drive incremental value?” These aren’t just theoretical problems – they’re daily realities affecting marketing professionals across various industries. The Next-Gen Revolution in MMM Objective Platform, an Amsterdam-based SaaS marketing measurement provider, is reimagining what’s possible with Marketing Mix Modelling. Trusted by leading brands including Unilever, Just Eat Takeaway, Odido, Deutsche Telekom, Rituals and VodafoneZiggo, the platform has analysed over €10 billion in media investments for brands. What makes this approach different? Transparency, automation and intelligence. Unlike traditional “black box” MMMs that deliver quarterly extracts, Objective Platform offers: Streamlined, automated data integration from 200+ sources Complete transparency from model configuration to insights Campaign-level granularity rather than the typical channel-level insights A Media Scenario Planner that optimises your plans for the best incremental results Meet Oppie: Your Optimisation Assistant The platform’s standout feature is “Oppie”, an intelligent media planning assistant that helps marketers optimise their media plans. Oppie analyses your current spending, identifies inefficiencies and recommends budget reallocations across channels – helping clients achieve up to 20% uplift in incremental ROAS.

Join us in London, Amsterdam, New York & Singapore. The evolution of search Search is evolving faster than anyone anticipated. With the rise of generative AI and large language models (LLMs), people no longer browse through pages of results — they ask questions and expect meaningful, conversational answers. For marketers, visibility looks different now. SEO today is less about technical tweaks and more about communication. The content that performs best isn’t just well-optimized — it’s clear, connected, and credible. Search systems increasingly reward the pages that show genuine understanding of a topic rather than those that simply check optimization boxes. The implication is immediate: scattered content and one-off articles won’t cut through. Brands need to think in systems — building well-structured, interconnected content ecosystems that make their expertise easy to recognize and trust. Building content for an LLM-first world Staying visible now means creating content that makes sense to both people and machines. The aim is to help algorithms recognize your expertise just as clearly as your audience does. Connect the dots Content can’t live in isolation. Smart internal linking, consistent language, and clear categories help search systems — and readers — see how your ideas relate and reinforce one another. Prioritize depth over breadth Own a few strategic themes rather than spreading thin across dozens of surface-level topics. A focused, well-developed content ecosystem sends stronger signals of expertise and trust. Build credibility into every piece Transparency, reliable sources, and visible authorship matter more than ever. These cues help AI systems decide what to surface and give readers confidence in your perspective. Design for flexibility Modular, reusable content makes it easier to adapt messages across formats and channels without losing consistency — critical when your work may be summarized or reinterpreted by machines. Start today Pick one priority topic, map the core questions your audience asks, and turn them into a connected cluster (overview, deep dives, how-tos, proof points). Add schema where relevant, and link the pieces together. Small, coherent systems beat large, fragmented libraries. Preparing for the next phase of SEO AI hasn’t replaced SEO — it’s redefining what effective SEO looks like. Visibility is no longer only about ranking; it’s about being understood. Search systems increasingly reward clarity, depth, and genuine expertise over quick optimizations or formulaic tactics. Teams that embrace this shift early will build more durable visibility. Well-structured, trustworthy content that communicates a brand’s strengths with precision stands out — to human audiences and to the AI systems shaping what gets seen. Those who stick to old habits risk slipping out of view as search continues to evolve — but for those willing to adapt, this shift opens up space for smarter, more meaningful visibility. Meet Storyblok at booth #292 during DMWF Amsterdam , and join Arthur’s talk, “AI Search and the Future of SEO: How to Stay Visible in a Machine-First World,” on the Search and media stage at 11:40 AM.

Join us in London, Amsterdam, New York & Singapore. The beginning of the millennium marked the dawn of modern internet culture. For the first time, ordinary people could create loyal global communities and have mainstream influence. Bloggers began generating revenue streams from brand deals typically reserved for celebrities. As these creators migrated to social media, influencer marketing became ubiquitous and prolific (and sometimes notorious). The influencer economy grew, creating more opportunities for creators and brands alike. But some wonder if influencer marketing’s potential has already reached its peak, and if investing so heavily in influencers and creators continues to make sense for brands. Data from Sprout Social ’s Q3 2025 Pulse Survey paints a clear picture. 64% of consumers say when a brand partners with their favorite influencers they’re more willing to buy. While influencers will continue to be a cultural mainstay, how they build communities and forge brand partnerships will evolve. What can the past and present reveal about the future of influencer marketing? Drawing on takeaways from Taylor Lorenz’s session at our Under the Brandfluence digital event and our latest research, we explore what led to the influencer boom and which future trends will inform the landscape. What is the future of influencer marketing? The past & present hold clues According to Goldman Sachs , there are 50 million global creators contributing to the creator economy, which is worth roughly $250 billion (a figure that’s expected to double by 2027). As the industry soars, algorithms are only becoming more niche and creator content more influential. Growing brand investment in influencer partnerships is rewriting marketing playbooks—evolving the industry for creators and marketers. How influencer marketing forever changed the media landscape The same Goldman Sachs report found that only 4% of creators pursue a full-time online career. Much like today, the internet’s first influencers (who emerged during the blogging era) thought of the internet as a side hustle or outlet for creative expression. As Lorenz explains, “Blogs allowed people to self-publish their own content. For example, women were writing super candidly about their daily lives. These were moms struggling with breastfeeding or postpartum depression who went on to have thousands and millions of subscribers or followers. They were talking about topics excluded from women’s media at the time, and redefining motherhood. Really, women, BIPOC and LGBTQIA+ people built this industry.” Despite their obvious influence and community-building expertise , these early influencers were harassed constantly, discredited for not having “real” jobs and dismissed as narcissists who took too many selfies (“Selfie even became the word of the year in 2013,” Lorenz points out). “So many early people on these platforms were outcasts. They didn’t have a lot of social capital. They didn’t have a voice in traditional media. They built these revenue models that so many people have come to profit off of,” says Lorenz. Many of the negative stereotypes about influencers persisted and intensified through the 2010s. The pandemic era was a major turning point for influencer acceptance (though, creator harassment will never disappear). Everyone went online, causing many people to realize for the first time that influencers alchemize culture. Brands depend on influencer marketing As the lines between social and traditional marketing continue to blur, old stereotypes are falling away and influencers are gaining credibility. More than half of people between the ages of 18-60 now state they would quit their jobs if they could become a full-time influencer. From a partnership perspective, 9 in 10 marketers say sponsored influencer content outperforms brand content in terms of engagement, per the Q1 2025 Sprout Pulse Survey. Another 83% say it converts better, and 65% are very confident that leaders see the business value of influencer partnerships. The same survey found that almost two-thirds of marketers plan to partner with more influencers this year. That translates to around 80% of marketing leaders increasing their influencer marketing budget, and about 25% divesting from traditional marketing channels to fund it, per The 2025 Impact of Social Media Marketing Report. As the pool of creators grows and brands fully realize the potential of influencer marketing, what it means to be an influencer will change. But, in many ways, Lorenz argues, influencers are still doing what they do best: building intensely loyal fandoms and creating online culture . 4 predictions for the future of influencer marketing In the wake of platform shakeups, economic confusion and emerging technology, some question the long-term impact and resonance of influencers. How can influencers continue to build revenue streams on emerging networks? Will AI influencers replace them? How can brands find influencers that actually resonate with their audience? As we look to the future of influencer marketing, certain answers are coming into focus. AI will drive operations, not stand in as talent While data from Sprout’s 2024 version of the State of Influencer Marketing Report points to 37% of all consumers being more interested in brands that work with AI influencers, Lorenz speculated this is a passing fad. She explains, “We already have faceless influencers. They’ve been around for a long time. What people want online is reliability—AI influencers don’t engender trust. Humans do.” Further, Sprout’s subsequent Q3 2025 Pulse Survey found that almost half of consumers say they’re not comfortable with brands using AI influencers. Full stop. When brands use AI influencers, it raises concerns about intellectual property misuse, content originality and real creators’ ability to participate in the creator economy. Yet, AI does offer something that will be invaluable to influencers: It makes extremely high quality content easier to produce. Tools like Jasper and Writer make it easier to write and edit posts and captions, while Wondershare Filmora and Descript speed up video editing. “What AI does very effectively is lower the barrier to content creation so influencers can create better content with less effort. The tools are getting more accessible every year. More and more high quality content is going to continue to shift the landscape because of that,” says Lorenz. Influencer discovery & sourcing will be rooted in topic relevancy, not demographics Algorithms are only getting more niche. Think about your own For You Page. It’s built around topics you find interesting, not necessarily your location, gender, age or the size of the creators you typically interact with. That’s exactly why brands will lead with the topics creators talk about when they conduct influencer sourcing . What does this look like? Historically it’s been highly manual, even with influencer marketing management software. Marketers had to rely on complex filtering, spend significant time vetting and comb through piles of data to ensure quality results. And even after logging hours of work, the influencer could still end up being a poor brand safety fit. Thankfully, that’s changing. Emerging AI-powered natural language discovery helps brands search based on the content they want to create. This approach ensures influencer content actually matches up with your brand values and campaign messaging—driving much stronger results. Influencer marketing won’t be limited to social media Per The State of Influencer Marketing Report, 80% of consumers are more likely to buy from brands that partner with influencers and creators on projects beyond social media content—like in-person events, brand trips or multi-channel ad campaigns. We’re already starting to see influencers slide into spokesperson roles previously held by actors, athletes and other pop culture icons. Brands are also building bottom of funnel influencer partnerships through creator storefront programs, like Lowe’s Creator Network and the new My Sephora Storefront. Expect to see more brands expand their influencer partnerships further than the confines of social. Doing so will require building long-term relationships with creators, and tapping into their expertise when it comes to understanding your shared audience. Influencer marketing career paths will flourish The Impact of Social Report found that three-quarters of marketing leaders anticipate growing their team in the next year, and influencer marketing managers are among the top five positions they’re likely to hire for. The increased investment in influencer marketing roles underscores just how legitimate the function has become—especially given the unsteady job market . Zooming out, this hiring trend gives long-term insight into how marketing leaders are building their teams . Influencer relationship management has become a foundational marketing pillar and ROI driver. Influencer programs can’t be scaled if they’re on someone’s plate alongside organic content creation, reporting and other duties. It deserves at least one dedicated role (if not more), and marketers that hone their skills in this area will become even more valuable to companies moving forward. The future belongs to brands that embrace influencers Influencer marketing rewrote the rules of traditional media. For brands today, it’s a non-negotiable way to increase discoverability, grow your audience, and even show a direct connection between marketing efforts and revenue. As platforms evolve and more influencers enter the arena, brands that lean into authentic partnerships will continue to see meaningful returns. The future won’t be defined by AI replacing creators, but by tools that empower them and strategies that prioritize relevancy over vanity metrics. Ultimately, the brands that thrive will be those that embrace influencers not as a trend, but as long-term partners shaping the next era of marketing.

    "content": "CMOs turn to AI to solve infinite puzzle About the Author By Marketing Tech News | 5th November 2025 Categories: Learn how to turn raw marketing data into actionable insights that improve ROI and campaign strategy. \">Data Analytics , Stay ahead with insights on using generative AI to boost content creation, campaign creativity, and real-time marketing experiences. \">Generative AI , Discover how to measure martech success and plan tech investments that align with business objectives. \">Martech ROI & Budgets , A survey by a UK public relations company shows despite the majority of CMOs using or trialling AI tools, half worry about data quality and integrity. A third of those surveyed worried about the potential for AI to dilute ‘the human touch’ according to a press release from the company. Yet the survey identified benefits of the technology in content creation and idea generation. Analysis of data continues to be problematic for many CMOs, and the survey findings suggest that while martech helps with content creation and strategic planning, there’s a lag in implementation of analysis tools, and many struggle to find the time to properly consider campaign metrics, which continues to be a more manual task. Traditional product marketing materials are becoming less effective, and nearly three-quarters said they place thought leadership and webinars as equally important. Direct engagement continues as central to B2B marketing. The survey [email submission required] highlights a disconnect between marketing investment and business impact in terms of ROI. Qualified sales and marketing leads are easier to quantify than customer acquisition costs, with only 30% of CMOs monitoring the latter. Lead generation, marketing analysis and PR are the main activities of most marketing departments, but many also cover sales enablement – the message is that marketers are expected to cover more areas of the business, and levels of overall responsibility are increasing. Comment: AI and data are not silver bullets There is a disconnect between the use of generative AI and thought-leadership content creation. Media creation models (LLMs and their image/video equivalents) can only respin existing materials, making any such material produced derivative by definition. Ideation suffers from the same problem: ideas published to the internet and consumed by an AI model will be surfaced by generative AI, albeit altered by a small randomising factor at the point of inference. This tendency can be combated by the presentation of live events, webinars, and online discussions, and the production of original media: content created by informed humans. Data analysis of absolute metrics (such as qualified leads) remains an easy algorithmic challenge for software. Measuring the success of broader campaigns has never been easy, and technology can only quantify representations of a brand’s impact in its digital manifestations – social media presence, search engine (and AI search) results, for example. Digital indicators such as posts being disseminated, shared and commented on, rankings by search engines or the surfacing of default answers by AI searches, are consistently manipulated by platform owners, users, or third-parties using bots or other gamifying technologies. The commissioning company behind the survey stated that “49% worry about data quality and integrity,” yet: “The findings highlight the importance of developing a defined AI strategy for marketing […]” While AI promises, to varying degrees, to be the magic bullet that will transform marketing, it’s becoming apparent in other sectors (creative arts, software development, customer service, medicine) that the technology is one tool among many. AI has specific abilities that may be of use in certain contexts. But like most tools, is best used alongside others. Marketing functions placing AI and data at the centre of their strategy are akin to house builders planning their work around their investment in a fleet of mechanical diggers: useful tools without doubt, but only capable of a few tasks on site and requiring human operators.

He has expertise in moderating webinars and presenting content on video, in addition to having a background in networking technology. Australia will soon block children under 16 from using most major social media sites, and the ban now includes Reddit and the live-streaming platform Kick. As reported by ABC News , the eSafety Commission ruled that both platforms are built mainly for online social media interaction, placing them in the same group as Snapchat, TikTok, YouTube, X, Facebook, Instagram, and its linked service Threads. Communications Minister Anika Wells said she met with the largest platforms in recent weeks to make sure there was “no excuse for failure” when the rules start on December 10. She said the review process would continue and that the list may change over time. “We aren’t chasing perfection, we are chasing a meaningful difference,” she said. Kick, based in Australia, competes with Twitch and draws an average audience of about 258,000 viewers. Reddit, built around discussion forums, is one of the most visited websites in the world. In the past few months, eSafety told several platforms they might be included and invited them to argue their case. After reviewing those submissions, regulators made their decision. Penalties for failing to block underage users From December 10, companies that do not take reasonable steps to stop Australians under 16 from holding accounts may face fines of up to $49.5 million. Some tech firms said the government waited too long to share clear instructions, which made it harder to prepare. At a Senate hearing last week, representatives from TikTok, Meta, and Snap said they would comply and block access for young teenagers when required. Snap’s global policy senior vice-president Jennifer Stout called Australia a “first mover” and said the company was “learning as we go.” Snap plans to offer a way for underage users to download and store their data before their accounts are locked. TikTok is testing account suspension options, and Meta is exploring similar tools for Instagram and Facebook. Concerns about harmful content and algorithms Wells said social media has a role in Australia, but argued there is no room for “predatory algorithms, harmful content and toxic popularity metres manipulating Australian children.” She warned that online platforms can target young people in ways that feel like “chilling control,” and said regulators will require platforms to use their own technology to protect them. eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said delaying social media access, in countries like Australia, gives children “valuable time to learn and grow” without the pull of endless scrolling and opaque algorithmic feeds. She urged parents to visit the eSafety website for resources and said there will be live webinars where people can ask questions. Platforms exempt from the new rules Some services will not fall under the new rules. Exempt categories include messaging, email, voice or video calling, online games, health, education, and services that help users find information about products. This means Roblox and messaging apps like WhatsApp and Messenger will not be blocked. Inman Grant said her agency asked Roblox to prevent adult users from contacting child users without parental consent. “We’re using other tools in our arsenal to keep these other platforms safer,” she said. She also said the agency is watching platforms that do not meet the criteria today but could draw teens trying to avoid the ban, including Yubo and Bluesky. “This is a dynamic list and will always change,” she said, adding that some platforms were “very much on the line.” As the rules take hold, attention is turning to age-verification tools. Many companies are testing new ways to check identity, including AI-driven document scans and basic biometric checks. These methods are raising questions about privacy and where personal data will be stored, but regulators say platforms already use similar systems to recommend content. Brand safety becomes a higher priority The ban may also push more investment in brand safety. With younger users pushed off major platforms, companies may need to rethink how they promote products aimed at teens. Retail, gaming, and consumer goods brands may shift to channels that have built-in parental oversight. Some may reconsider how they handle targeted ads, audience analytics, and sponsorship deals tied to creators who reach younger crowds. The rules may also raise interest in platforms that offer parental consent options. Companies are exploring tools that let parents manage sign-ups, approve contacts, or check activity logs. These features could grow as more countries consider similar restrictions. At the same time, kid-safe ecosystems are growing. These include curated video apps, moderated chat spaces, and closed communities built with safety controls. Many rely on smaller groups, verified adults, and clear parental access. While these platforms attract less attention, they may become more appealing to families and brands looking to avoid fines or public criticism. Marketing strategies may shift For marketers, the changes may shift how they think about youth-focused campaigns. With fewer teenagers on major platforms, companies may look for partnerships in gaming, education, and community spaces that remain accessible. Influencer strategies may shift as well, especially for creators who rely on younger fans. Brands may also revisit where they collect engagement data as platform demographics change. Australia’s approach has started a wider conversation about how young people spend time online, and how much control algorithms should have over them. Other governments will be watching to see if age checks can work in practice, and whether platforms can strike a fair balance between access and safety.

He has a keen interest in artificial intelligence, robotics, and nanotechnology. David researches and stays current with the latest tech developments through forums, podcasts, blogs, and more. Beyond his specialisations, he has explored niches including lifestyle, sports, entertainment, and his first love, music. Provus Inc , an AI-powered services estimation, pricing, and quoting solutions provider, has revealed its first-of-a-kind agentic AI platform, Provus AI , designed specifically for services quoting. The platform has been purpose-built to automate, optimise, and accelerate the revenue lifecycle for services-based engagements, providing services organisations with the means to improve win rates, safeguard margins, and increase profits, the company claims. In the technology industry, services make up approximately two-thirds of revenue. However, sales representatives spend less than a third of their time actively selling, instead spending time on tasks like quote creations and handling administrative work. To help save time on such tasks, Provus AI hopes to automate such manual processes, using a business’s past sales strategies, market data, and win rates to learn from and improve on. Therefore, quotes can be generated automatically with consistent accuracy, helping sales teams free up time for practical work selling. “Every year, services organisations lose millions of dollars due to manual quoting,” said Stawan Kadepurkar, Provus co-founder and CEO. “Provus AI brings agentic intelligence to services estimation, pricing, and quoting solutions, helping organisations move beyond static workflows to dynamic, AI-driven deal execution that is faster, more accurate, and built for enterprise scale. Our platform gives revenue teams a full 360-degree view of every opportunity to ensure that deals are not only won, but that they are won with the right margins, compliance, and [in line with] strategy.” Provus AI integrates information from several sources, including existing workflows, company employees, internal systems, external market data, and industry intelligence. It gathers data to generate insights and “signals” that help sales teams AI Agents integrated in Provus AI are: Quote Optimiser – Refines pricing strategies to boost profitability. Deal Predictor – Forecasts the chance of deal success. Proposal Response – Assists in creating faster and more relevant responses to proposals. Deal Rescue – Identifies and addresses opportunities that are at-risk to help minimise and prevent losses. Provus Admin – Automatically manages time-consuming administrative tasks in the platform. A key feature in Provus AI is Discovery Intelligence, built to transform “raw conversations and documents into structured outputs to compute a complete quote in minutes.” Provus AI analyses sales calls to identify potential challenges and opportunities. The platform ensures any insights are reflected in ensuing quotes and proposals, so the requests for proposals (RFPs) become more precise, relevant, and more likely to enjoy success, the company says. Core Analysis is a feature connected to a company’s data sources like enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM), and professional services automation (PSA). It helps identify margin risks, calculates win probability, tracks deal progress, and provides recommendations based on performance. Field Intelligence lets teams scan external data sources such as LinkedIn and applicable industry publications. It is capable of tracking competitors, pricing patterns, and regulations in a market, aiding businesses make more accurate financial decisions. Chris Murphy, Thoughtworks Global Chief Client and Revenue Officer and Provus customer, spoke of AI’s impact on his company and the changed professional services sector. “The past practice of charging for people’s time is rapidly going away in an AI-first world. Pricing now is a combination of people, tools, accelerators, and AI agents working together to create an outcome – with pricing linked to that outcome, rather than the effort taken to create it.” (Image source: “The hard sell !” by CJS*64 is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.)

    "content": "The implications of China’s new influencer law for marketing accountability About the Author By Marketing Tech News | 30th October 2025 Categories: Explore how design, voice, and storytelling shape brand identity in digital spaces and influence audience perception. \">Brand Identity , Navigate the evolving ethical landscape of digital marketing including AI use, transparency, and consumer manipulation. \">Marketing Ethics , Build effective brand messaging tailored to audience segments, channels, and customer journeys using behavioral insights. \">Messaging Strategy , China’s new influencer regulation came into effect on 25 October and is an most assertive attempt to enforce expertise and empirical knowledge in digital content. The rule requires creators discussing regulated topics like finance, law, medicine, and education to hold recognised qualifications before they can publish online. For marketing leaders, it’s a compliance story, but also signals changes to the ways that platforms and audiences define digital credibility. The regulation will reshape how Chinese brands select influencers. It’s likely that there will also be influence (apologies for the weak pun) on global content standards. In Spain, the 2024 “Influencer Law” takes a parallel approach, requiring creators with annual income above €300,000 or in excess of a million followers to register and comply with advertising rules. While European regulation focuses more on transparency and fiscal accountability than content expertise, the direction is similar: institutionalising professional responsibility in the creator economy. In markets like Spain and China, where influencer engagement is part of digital strategy, this adds a new layer of operational due diligence. The shift will push marketers to weigh creative authenticity against expertise, especially in high-trust categories such as healthcare, fintech, and education. With marketing canon stating the importance of trust between brand and customer, marketing professionals should be aware that legislation – currently limited to specific countries – reflects the public’s mood for transparency and honesty in all communications from businesses and organisations. Business impact of influencer ethics In China, platforms such as Douyin, Bilibili, and Weibo must now verify influencer credentials and require disclosure of which content draws on research, or AI-generation. The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) has also extended accountability to the platforms carrying the messages, mandating they educate users about responsible sharing of posts. It also extends to restrictions on advertising medical products and health foods. For global brands, this means campaigns have to be adapted. Influencer ethics will need to be manifest in briefs, initially in China and Spain, and should to include credential checks, approved citation standards, and legal sign-off. Some digital ecosystems are quietly enforcing their own accountability systems. Google’s “Your Money or Your Life” (YMYL) policy sets standards in experience and trustworthiness about health, finance, or legal advice, with assessment through its EEAT framework. YouTube and Instagram have expanded labelling for paid promotions, although enforcement is a hit-and-miss affair. The developments point to the beginning of a reappraisal of digital marketing ethics. Brands that depend on influencer-driven awareness don’t necessarily have to navigate a complex mesh of jurisdictional compliance, but the legislative winds are blowing. Implementation and challenges Credential verification adds administrative overhead, and creative teams’ choices of influencers should now entail deeper research into the knowledge and experience of their chosen spokespeople. For creative teams it means balancing spontaneity with substantiated expertise. Overheads to be sure, but the benefits to brand value of more trustworthy content will be immeasurable. Influencer culture thrives on relatability and speed. “Successful roll-outs depend on retraining content teams and redefining what authenticity means under compliance pressure,” says one Shanghai-based marketing strategist. “If you don’t invest in those changes early, campaigns will stall.” Strategic takeaways for marketing leaders Reassess influencer due diligence. Marketers operating in China or Spain need to establish verification workflows for creators, especially when discussing regulated subjects. Map compliance impact across regions. Spain’s legislation and Google’s EEAT guidelines suggest a broader shift toward expertise-based governance. Prepare for similar measures in other jurisdictions. Balance creative freedom with accountability. While policies and legislation in some territories may appear restrictive, they should raise professional standards in the creator economy. Transparency and expertise strengthen consumer trust and the overall credibility of any campaign. For enterprise marketers, the lesson isn’t to avoid and lobby against regulation but to anticipate it. Building credibility into campaign design is as important as reach and engagement. Successful influencer marketing will happen when creative authenticity is combined with operational discipline, and be able to prove it.

    "content": "PayPal brings AI chat commerce into enterprise payments About the Author By Muhammad Zulhusni | 30th October 2025 Categories: Discover how AI-driven strategies elevate campaign performance with precision targeting, automation, and measurable impact. \">AI-Powered Campaigns , Live & e-Commerce , Enhance customer satisfaction with tailored product recommendations and AI-driven shopping journeys. \">Personalised Shopping , As a tech journalist, Zul focuses on topics including cloud computing, cybersecurity, and disruptive technology in the enterprise industry. He has expertise in moderating webinars and presenting content on video, in addition to having a background in networking technology. AI chat tools are becoming a new place for people to shop, pushing enterprise teams to rethink how they handle payments. PayPal’s move to use the Agentic Commerce Protocol with OpenAI points to closer ties between payments and AI. The deal between ChatGPT and PayPal letting users inside AI chats will come into effect next year. Merchants that already use PayPal can show their products inside the chat tool without building extra software. PayPal will handle payments, from routing and checks to tracking orders and helping with disputes. The company said the goal is to help users move from a product suggestion to a completed order inside the chat window. PayPal shares rose about 4% in value after the news, as investors watch for new commerce channels at a time when growth on traditional e-commerce sites has slowed. What this means for buyers and sellers People are now turning to AI chat tools to find items and compare prices, and merchants are keen to access to that traffic without the cost of new software development. Payment platforms want to be trusted parts of that flow. In a simple case, a customer might ask ChatGPT for a pair of trainers under a set price, choose from a short list, pay with PayPal, and check delivery status through the chat. For merchants, it’s a way to reach new buyers without extra engineering work. PayPal also plans to support OpenAI’s Instant Checkout tool by managing card payments through a delegated payments API. Buyers can pay from cards, bank accounts, or stored balances, and may get help with fraud checks and disputes. PayPal says both sides of the transaction are already verified through its wallet system, which may help small sellers that often struggle with fraud risk in borders. What enterprises need to think about Bringing AI chat into payment flows often exposes retailers’ data discrepancies. Product data must be accurate, and pricing rules must be consistent. Delivery systems must be ready to support orders placed through a channel that doesn’t look like a normal store. Tax and compliance rules still take effect in regions, and can vary widely in different areas. The shift may also add pressure to companies already testing AI platforms like Amazon Bedrock, Azure AI Foundry, and Salesforce Agentforce. The systems aim to support controlled access to AI-powered services. Groups with unclear data sets or messy product catalogues may have trouble making their items discover-able by an AI model. PayPal plans to expand its own use of OpenAI’s tools for more than 24,000 employees. That includes giving engineers access to code tools that may shorten development cycles. Companies exploring similar tools will need access controls and training so staff know how to use them safely. A wider look at the change The shift goes beyond payments, with AI chat tools becoming points of sale rather than just language models. With more than 700 million weekly users on ChatGPT, some shoppers may visit websites less often, which raises questions about brand visibility and competition. Some firms want to act as the core payment layer for this shift. PayPal has signed other deals tied to AI search, and it wants to handle the background work for merchants. Whether customers and enterprise partners stick with this approach will depend on security, data governance, and how well internal systems connect to it. What enterprise leaders can do now: Treat AI-driven chat tools as a new sales channel and watch where customer discovery moves. Check current payment rules for cross-border risk, fraud checks, and dispute support. Review the quality of product, price, and delivery data before feeding it into an AI system. Explore alignment with AI platforms like Bedrock, Azure AI Foundry, or Vertex AI for future flexibility. Test internal AI tools with clear rules, limited access, and training for engineers, product teams, and support staff. As more buyers start their journey inside a chat window, companies that prepare now may find it easier to manage the transition and create trust in transactions, as AI’s role grows in enterprise commerce.

    "content": "Secure prepaid tags could boost retailers’ confidence in gift cards About the Author By Marketing Tech News | 27th October 2025 Categories: Use real-time behavioral data to deliver the right message at the right time across the entire customer journey. \">Behavioural Targeting , Deliver tailored content experiences using personalization strategies powered by AI, behavior data, and customer profiles. \">Content Personalisation , Visualise and optimize the full customer journey to improve conversions and retention with data-led insights. \">Journey Mapping , Live & e-Commerce , Gift cards remain one of retail’s most resilient revenue drivers, but they have become a growing target for fraudsters. The US Federal Trade Commission estimates that a quarter of reported scams involve tampered or counterfeit cards. The operational fallout for merchants is significant, costing several a significant percentage of income from gift cards. A new range of prepaid tag solutions from Infineon Technologies (in partnership with Karta Gift Card) aims to address the problem by combining NFC technology with cryptographic protection. How the technology works The technology replaces printed barcodes and magnetic stripes with a chip that holds encrypted credentials. Customers activate or redeem cards simply by tapping either an NFC-enabled phone or a physical gift card at the point of sale. Data is stored on a protected chip rather than being visible on packaging, so blocking common theft and cloning methods. Infineon has released two versions of its secured prepaid tag: one for open-loop cards processed through global payment networks such as Visa and Mastercard, the other for closed-loop cards confined to a retailer’s own systems. The solution integrates industry-standard AES encryption and dynamic validation for every transaction. Each tap triggers cryptographic checks that confirm the card’s legitimacy. For retailers, that means lower chargeback exposure and greater trust from consumers. The infrastructure can fit into existing smart card or ticket production systems, reducing the need for manufacturing changes for card producers. Business upside for retailers Fraud prevention is the most obvious win, but there are peripheral benefits for customer confidence and retailers’ operational efficiency. A secure tap-to-redeem process eliminates the manual verification steps staff currently perform when customers question a balance or dispute a transaction. Cards using the platform might also be pressed into service as digital loyalty identifiers, integrating with CRM systems for post-purchase engagement or reactivation campaigns. Retailers can link gift cards to app their branded apps, using the same NFC technology to encourage repeat visits and gather rich customer data. Competitive context Infineon’s platform is similar in aim with those of other semiconductor and payment security firms looking to strengthen trust in the digital and physical prepaid ecosystem. NXP’s MIFARE DESFire and STMicroelectronics’ STPay-based gift card technologies also support secure tap interactions and tokenisation models. Retailers weighing their options should assess which solution aligns best with existing POS and loyalty schemes, the potential overheads of integration into the existing tech stack, and the costs associated with card personalisation. While the available platforms differ in technical detail, their direction is the same – to create a more secure, contactless retail system that can build loyalty and protect revenue. For multi‑brand operators, adopting one or more of these systems could deliver measurable returns through lower fraud costs. Conclusions Gift cards are seen as an evolution from static payment products to dynamic engagement tools. Yet security remains central to customer and retailer trust. Solutions from Infineon and others suggest a future where tapping replaces scratch-to-reveal and digital encryption removes the element of security risk by the use of visible codes on cards. For retailers, this kind of upgrade is a defence against fraud and can be part of more personalised, data-driven marketing strategy.
